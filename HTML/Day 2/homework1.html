        <p><h2>Mahatma Gandhi</h2><br>
        <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as Mahatma Gandhi or Bapu, was a revered leader in India's fight for independence from British colonial rule. Born on <strong>October 2, 1869</strong>, Gandhi is renowned for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, or "satyagraha," which emphasized the power of truth and moral force. His leadership inspired millions of Indians to join the struggle for freedom through nonviolent means, such as civil disobedience and peaceful protests. Gandhi's most famous act of civil disobedience was the Salt March in <strong>1930</strong>, a 240-mile journey to protest British salt monopolies. He lived a simple and austere life, advocating for self-sufficiency and social and economic equality. Tragically, Gandhi was assassinated on <strong>January 30, 1948</strong>, by a Hindu nationalist who disagreed with his principles. However, his legacy endures as a symbol of peace, unity, and the power of nonviolence, inspiring movements for civil rights and social justice worldwide. Gandhi's birthday, <strong>October 2nd</strong>, is celebrated as Gandhi Jayanti in India and observed as the International Day of Non-Violence globally.</i></p>
        <p><h3>Achievements:</h3></p>
         <ul>
            <li><i>Nonviolent Resistance and Civil Disobedience: Gandhi's most prominent achievement was his development and advocacy of nonviolent resistance (satyagraha) and civil disobedience as powerful tools for social and political change. He successfully employed these strategies in various movements and campaigns, including the Salt March, Quit India Movement, and the Indian independence struggle. His commitment to nonviolence inspired not only India but also movements for civil rights and justice worldwide.</i></li>
            <li><i>Indian Independence: Gandhi's leadership and tireless efforts played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule. His ability to mobilize millions of Indians, along with his principles of nonviolence, made him a central figure in the eventual attainment of India's freedom in 1947. The peaceful, nonviolent approach he championed set a powerful precedent for future movements and leaders.</i></li>
            <li><i>Promotion of Social Reforms: Gandhi was also a strong advocate for social and economic reforms in India. He worked tirelessly to eradicate untouchability, promote Hindu-Muslim unity, and champion the rights of women. His campaigns, such as the Harijan Movement and his emphasis on self-reliance (Sarvodaya), aimed to create a more just and equitable society in India.</i></li>

        <p><h2>Bhagat Singh</h2><br>
        <i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Bhagat Singh, born on <stong>September 28, 1907</stong>, was a fearless and dedicated Indian freedom fighter who left an indelible mark on the struggle for India's independence from British colonial rule. His unwavering commitment to the cause and readiness to take bold action set him apart. Bhagat Singh was not afraid to resort to more aggressive means, and he is best known for his involvement in the bombing of the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi in <strong>1929</strong> as a symbol of resistance. Inspired by the Jallianwala Bagh massacre of <strong>1919</strong>, where British troops brutally killed innocent Indian civilians, he felt compelled to take a stand. Bhagat Singh's resolve was further evident in his participation in hunger strikes while imprisoned, protesting against the harsh treatment of political detainees. Ultimately, he, along with fellow revolutionaries Rajguru and Sukhdev, was sentenced to death for their role in the killing of a British police officer. On <strong>March 23, 1931</strong>, they were executed in Lahore Central Jail, becoming enduring symbols of sacrifice and bravery in the Indian independence movement. Bhagat Singh's legacy lives on, serving as a powerful source of inspiration for generations of Indians striving for justice, freedom, and equality.</i></p>
        <p><h3>Achievements:</h3></p>
        <ul>
            <li><i>Central Legislative Assembly Bombing: Bhagat Singh, along with his associates, threw non-lethal smoke bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi in 1929. This daring act was intended to protest against repressive British legislation and to demand the release of political prisoners. While no one was harmed, the action brought widespread attention to the cause of Indian independence and the courage of Bhagat Singh and his comrades.</i></li>
            <li><i>Hunger Strikes: While in prison, Bhagat Singh and his fellow inmates undertook hunger strikes to protest against the inhumane treatment of political prisoners. His hunger strike in 1930, which lasted 116 days, gained immense public sympathy and support. It highlighted the harsh conditions endured by those who had dedicated themselves to the fight for freedom.</i></li>
            <li><i>Martyrdom: Perhaps Bhagat Singh's most profound achievement was his unwavering commitment to the cause of Indian independence, even in the face of imminent death. He was sentenced to death for his involvement in the killing of British police officer J.P. Saunders and, along with Rajguru and Sukhdev, willingly faced the gallows on March 23, 1931. This ultimate sacrifice elevated him to the status of a martyr and a symbol of the indomitable spirit of the Indian freedom struggle.</i></li>
