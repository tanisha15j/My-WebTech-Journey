        <p><b><i>Subject: Taking a leave</i></b></p>
        <p><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to formally request a leave of absence from work for personal reasons.
        During my absence, I will ensure that all of my responsibilities are properly handled. I am committed to providing a smooth transition of my duties and will work with my colleagues to ensure that there is minimal disruption to the workflow. If necessary, I am willing to provide guidance or support remotely during my leave, as long as it does not interfere with my primary reason for taking this leave.
        I understand the importance of my role and the responsibilities I hold within the company, and I will do everything in my power to make this transition as seamless as possible.
        Thank you for your understanding and consideration of my request. If you have any questions or require further information, please do not hesitate to contact me via email at tanisha@mail.com
        I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your positive response.</i></b></p>
        <p><b><i>Yours Sincerely, <br> Tanisha</i></b></p>
